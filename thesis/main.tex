%%            Please verify your thesis' formatting and copyright

%%            MIT Libraries' specs, please let us know

%% The documentclass options along with the pagestyle can be used to generate
%% a technical report, a draft copy, or a regular thesis.  You may need to
%% re-specify the pagestyle after you \include  cover.tex.  For more
%% information, see the first few lines of mitthesis.cls.
